* Try it

What is it?

* Collects metrics from GCP, AWS and hybrid cloud resources
* Dashboards and visualisations
* Alerting and anomaly reporting
* Predefined and custom metrics
* Monitoring agents

Using it

* A VM has by default a number of metrics. But you can install an additional monitoring agent (Cloud Monitor's) to do more
* Use the Metric Explorer to find and chart metrics
* Use alerts to define conditions when something should be alerted on
* Health checks - define a uptime check to measure if it is up
